## About

### üåç Gravity Simulator (p5.js)

A simple gravity simulation built with **p5.js**. Planets pull on asteroids, and the asteroids respond to gravitational forces. Planets themselves stay fixed in place.

#### Features:

- **Multiple planets** exert gravity on asteroids.
- **Asteroids are influenced by combined gravitational forces**.
- Real-time calculations for **acceleration in x and y directions**.
- Visual polish with **glow effects and opacity changes** for some sprites for the planets, astroids, trails and explosions.
- Some **basic physics calculations** for gravitational force and acceleration.

#### üï∞Ô∏è Built For Fun

Made this in **2-3 hours on a cold Sunday afternoon** when I was a little bit sick and bored.  
For now it's just a fun little experiment‚Äîmight expand on it later, might not.

#### üñºÔ∏è Preview

Feel free to **fork it or tinker with it**‚Äîit's just a playground for physics and visuals!
